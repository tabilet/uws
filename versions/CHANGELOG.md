# UWS Versions Changelog

This changelog summarizes externally visible changes between published UWS
versioned schemas and specification documents. The versioned `.md` files remain
the normative human-readable specifications.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-04-28

- Added portable `timeout` fields on Operation, Workflow, and Step objects.
- Added workflow-level `idempotency` metadata for logical workflow-run de-duplication.
- Added validation requirements for positive timeout values, required idempotency keys,
  `onConflict` enum values, and positive `ttl` values.
- Clarified that idempotency storage, retry replay protection, and timeout enforcement details
  are executor responsibilities outside the serialized wire format.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-04-26

- Initial UWS 1.0.0 specification and JSON Schema.
- Defined OpenAPI-bound operations, workflow structure, request binding, structural control flow,
  triggers, results, success criteria, failure/success actions, runtime expressions, and extension
  profiles.
- Reserved the `x-uws-` extension prefix and defined `x-uws-operation-profile`.
